# CDI Playground - inject-jdbc

This play area is incomplete as it lacks the JDBC connection properties and uses a specific database schema. It's up to the user to set up the databases, MySQL and SQL Server, and configure the connections and the queries to fit the database installed.

    `mvn clean install`

To run:

    `java -cp target/inject-jdbc-1.0.jar Main`

Expected Output:

```

```
